LaMusique a single page application that has everything you need to 
- search for an artist, an album, or a track with a single keyword
- listen to anything you find on the spot
- create a custom category to make a list of your own playlist
- manage categories
- view the artist's upcoming concerts, tours, or perfomance show schedules in Canada
- and finally allow users to access a direct link to buy a ticket in advance

Tech Stack used is MERN with collections in the database being relational between users and their categories for efficient handling of user experience.
Future version will be to include features to add/follow friends, view and share playlist with them, along with the history of purchased ticket for the show.
